Sometimes I work on web stuff, sometimes Android apps, and most of the time I’m just figuring things out as I go. I have a degree in Information Technology, but let’s be real — most of what I’ve actually learned came from messing around, following my curiosity, and just building things. And yeah, that also means a lot of time spent stuck on bugs. There have been nights where I’ve felt completely down just because I couldn’t get something to work the way I wanted it to.",
        "desc_2": " I’m not the best with words, but this is me trying. Sharing a bit about myself. I could go on writing about how I do this and that, but honestly, that’s not really my style. I’ve always believed that actions speak louder than words — so this is probably the most I’ll ever write about myself. Truth is, I don’t fully know myself either — this “self” that everyone seems to think they’ve figured out. I'm just out here trying things, learning, building, failing, and trying again. That’s all there is to it."
