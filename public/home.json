Well i'm a Developer (i really don't know which one - sometimes i work on web, sometimes on android apps, sometimes create things from scrach with C, even sometimes write games with godot). I have a degree in Information technology but lets be real most of what i learnt was via experimentation and curosity. Just making things and then suffering with bugs (There were nights when i was/am so down because i couldn't do what i wanted to do/create.",
        "desc_2": "I'm not really great with words but this is my attempt of talking to you. Shearing about-me. I could write text on and on about i do this and that. That's not my style afterall i am a strong believer of actions speak for themselves so this is the most i can write. Realistically I dont' know myself this stranger which most people claim to know."
