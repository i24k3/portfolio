Whatever lands and then it's more of like figuring out how not just to make it work but with the idea how to make it sustain. You will explore here ideas, some finished Projects. Some unfinished Struggles floating around. Thats the point its the Journey that counts right?"

Well i'm a Developer (i really don't know which one - sometimes i work on web, sometimes on android apps, sometimes create things from scrach with C, even sometimes write games with godot). I have a degree in Information technology but lets be real most of what i learnt was via experimentation and curosity. Just making things and then suffering with bugs (There were nights when i was/am so down because i couldn't do what i wanted to do/create.",
        "desc_2": "I'm not really great with words but this is my attempt of talking to you. Shearing about-me. I could write text on and on about i do this and that. That's not my style afterall i am a strong believer of actions speak for themselves so this is the most i can write. Realistically I dont' know myself this stranger which most people claim to know."
