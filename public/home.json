Sometimes I work on web stuff, sometimes Android apps, and most of the time I’m just figuring things out as I go. I have a degree in Information Technology, but let’s be real — most of what I’ve actually learned came from messing around, following my curiosity, and just building things. And yeah, that also means a lot of time spent stuck on bugs. There have been nights where I’ve felt completely down just because I couldn’t get something to work the way I wanted it to.",

I’ve always believed that actions speak louder than words — so this is probably the most I’ll ever write about myself. Truth is, I don’t fully know myself either — this “self” that everyone seems to think they’ve figured out. I'm just out here trying things, learning, building, failing, and trying again. That’s all there is to it."

Still, it wasn't enough as when i met a senior dev. I was able to visualise the knowledge gap."

I mostly did the things hard way to better understand how things work underneath for example instead of using react-router-dom i was instructed to create one myself and then use it. The experience grounded me, honestly humbled me down — I realized how different real-world development is from just gluing stuff together on your own."

Simple: it watches a folder in your project, and whenever you add a new file — boom — it auto-fills it with boilerplate code. JSX, TSX, JS, TS — whatever you like. You can even customize the templates or add your own file types. It’s like Emmet, but even lazier. I built it mostly because I was tired of writing the same stuff 10 times when setting up components. Got 138 downloads in 2 days after posting, which was cool - makes me feel better that i am not the only lazy one out there. Oh, and it's built using just Node’s built-in modules — no dependencies, works on all OSes. Mission Successfull.",

Every section is handcrafted — no generic 'skills' grid, no corporate resume tone. Just me, talking to whoever’s on the other side of the screen. From the custom raindrop-style cursor to expandable project cards and animated toggles, everything was built to feel interactive, curious, and slightly unexpected.",
